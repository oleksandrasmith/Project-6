Features
- Each time the player guesses a letter, it is compared with the random phrase.
- If the letter is in the phrase, the game board updates with the chosen letters.
- A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. 
- If the letter they chose isn’t in the phrase, the player loses 1 of their 5 guesses.
- If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. 
- If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.
- A player can guess a letter only once. After they’ve guessed a letter, the program disables that letter.
